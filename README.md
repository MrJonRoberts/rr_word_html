# rr_word_html
 converts docx to html and generates a blank stylesheet for the html based on word styles.

requires a basic understanding of css.

# SET full to true if you want the style sheet.

By default it will include a simple body reset - although not recommended 
for production use, it is useful for testing and development.

NOTE: It is slow and is 90 mins work so far, and very untested, and RR does not allow 'styles' in the Tiny editor.

It can produce very large HTML files which are crap to view in a browser..
